Feature: Manage TODO tasks

    As a user
    I want to add, remove and check my TODO tasks
    So that I always know what are my pending tasks

    Background:
        Given I visit the TODO homepage

   Scenario: Add a new TODO
        When I submit a new TODO "My Task #1"
        And I submit a new TODO "My Task #2"
        Then the count of pending items is 2

    Scenario: Check a item
         Given I submitted a new TODO "My Task #1"
         When I check the item #1
         Then the count of pending items is 0
